# NeoHTTP Server

## Overview
NeoHTTP Server is a highly efficient, scalable, and feature-rich HTTP server designed for commercial use. Built using Java and optimized to run seamlessly on Debian, NeoHTTP Server leverages advanced concurrency mechanisms and state-of-the-art Java libraries to deliver robust performance. Integrated with Neovim for development, the server offers a seamless experience for developers and system administrators. The front-end and administration interface use HTMX, ensuring a dynamic and interactive user experience. NeoHTTP Server supports various media delivery optimizations and integrates smoothly with CDNs.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-threaded Request Processing**: Efficient handling of concurrent connections using a custom thread pool.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Utilizing Java NIO for optimal resource utilization.
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Secure communications with SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Comprehensive Media Support**: Dynamic content serving based on device type (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **MongoDB Integration**: Flexible, schema-less data storage with MongoDB.

### Admin Interface
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Monitor server health, traffic, and performance metrics.
- **User Management**: Manage users, roles, and permissions through a user-friendly interface.
- **Configurable Logging Levels**: Adjust logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) via configuration files.

### Performance and Security
- **Advanced Authentication**: Secure user sessions using JWT.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Performance Optimization**: Extensive performance and stress testing to ensure high efficiency.

## Architecture
NeoHTTP Server is built with a modular architecture, allowing easy addition of new features and components. The server uses a selector-based approach for non-blocking I/O, reducing the need for a large number of threads. The custom thread pool management ensures efficient use of system resources, while comprehensive error handling mechanisms provide robustness.
